# ChessVisionZero â™Ÿâš¯`0`
A simple blindfold chess drill, inspired by chess.com/vision

This is a simple chess drill that trains your board vision and blindfold chess skills.

Usage:
```
./chessvisionzero.sh [numsquares]
```

## How to use it
Run the script on the command line. It will spit out a bunch of names of squares on the chess board.
Visualize each square in your head as well as you can. When you are satisfied with your "board vision"
for that square, hit Enter to get the next square.
 - By default, the script will spit out ten squares and then quit, but you can give a bigger (or smaller)
 number as a command-line argument.

I wrote this based on an idea I got from the ["Vision trainer" on chess.com](https://www.chess.com/vision).
I was annoyed by the unnatural feeling of the available mouse and touch interfaces, and I figured that
chess players who are strong enough shouldn't need a board for the drill anyway, so I wrote this as a simpler
drill.

In the future, I want to flesh this out into a more full-featured program, possibly including a GUI.
